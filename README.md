# NX

NX is a next generation client side framework. For more information please visit the [home page](http://nx-framework.com/)

## Installation

The best option is to download NX from the home page. If you would like to get it from npm instead, use the `npm install @risingstack/nx-framework` command.

## Contributing

NX is designed to have a small core with a middleware system. If you have a great idea please consider putting it into a separate middleware before adding it to the NX core.

Bug fixes and tests are always welcome. Thanks!
